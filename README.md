# RSA Encryption

The following code is an RSA Encryption program developed for a Discrete Structures course, although development is ongoing.

It utilizes the Cryptodome library for generation and conversion of prime numbers, which are integral for the RSA algorithm.

# Future Plans
- More secure encryption (replacing "random" library) 
- Better UI/UX
- Image encryption
- Video encryption (?)
- Replacement of Cryptodome library

Note: although this is fully working RSA Encryption program, it shouldn't be used for cybersecurity do to the nature of
