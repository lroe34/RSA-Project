# RSA Encryption

The following code is an RSA Encryption program developed and submitted as a homework assignment for a Discrete Structures course, although development is still ongoing.

It utilizes the Cryptodome library for generation and conversion of prime numbers, which are integral for the RSA algorithm. When run, the program prompts the user for a string to encrypt. After entered, the program encrypts the string, prints that to the terminal and finally decrypts the encrypted sting.

## Future Plans
- ~~More secure encryption (replacing "random" library)~~
- Better UI/UX
- Image encryption
- Video encryption (?)
- Replacement of Cryptodome library
